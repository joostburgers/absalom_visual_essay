								The <em>Digital Yoknapatawpha</em> database contains every character who appears in Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha fictions.
								Each character has a set of attribute information, including their race, class, gender, number, rank, and vitality.
								With this information, we can make a literary demography of the composition of the entire character population.

							<p>
								One of the most salient pieces of demographic information in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> is its racial composition. The novel powerfully captures the Southern system of racial oppression that started with the enslavement of Africans before the Civil War and was continued through the creation of "Jim Crow" segretation laws after the Emancipation Proclamation. This long history of racial separation and its codification into explicit laws and implicit social practices, made race appear as a real and fundamental difference between people, even, if it was entirely socially constructed. Speaking of race in America more generally, Toni Morrison remarks that, "As a reader you have been forced to hunt for a drop of black blood that means everything and nothing. The insanity of racism."

						<div class="activity-instructions">
							<p>
								Faulkner questions the difference between people based on race by suggesting that Charles Bon could be both brother and other to Judith and Henry Sutpen. This troubling of racial categories is visible in the character breakdown of the novel. There are 194 unique characters in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>. These characters can in turn be grouped by race. Doing so creates a raw demographic total for each group. This indicates the relative percentage of each racial group of the entire cast of characters.
							</p>
							<p>
								Notably, this breakdown does not take into account how often characters occur. By calculating how often characters of a particular race occur in an event across the novel, we can capture how present they are in the novel. If <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> were a movie, this would be the relative screen-time dedicated to each racial group.

												<p>There are important differences between the raw demographic total and the weighted demographic presence.</p>

											</div>

											<div class="step-text" data-step="1">
												<div class="step_header">Over-representation</div>
												<p>Meanwhile, weighting by narrative presence actually reveals that White characters are over-represented. They only constitute 66% of the total characters, but are present in 77% of events.</p>
												<p>This shows that the narrative is focused on relating the lives of the White characters more than the other characters present.</p>
											</div>

											<div class="step-text" data-step="2">
												<div class="step_header">Mixed Ancestry</div>
												<p>Likewise, by accounting for how often characters actually appear in the text, the number of of mixed ancestry characters goes up.</p>
												<p>Intuitively, this makes sense because while there are relatively few of these characters in the world of the text, characters like Clytemnestra and Charles Bon appear quite often.</p>
											</div>

											<div class="step-text" data-step="3">
												<div class="step_header">Erasing Blackness</div>
												<p>Importantly, the increased focus on mixed ancestry characters comes at the cost of the Black characters. As individuals these characters recede into the background and do not have the same narrative presence as the white and the mixed ancestry characters.</p>
												<p>This distinction highlights the fact that novel is focused on showing White characters interact with characters of Mixed Ancestry.</p>

							<p>
								The data suggest that while <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> is concerned with the 'color line', it is decidedly from a White perspective. Race and racial passing is only conceived in how it might trouble Whiteness and not how it might affect the Black community. This is visible with the presence of Charles Bon. He is the most ubiquitous Mixed Ancestry character by far. Still, compared to the other White characters he is simply another major character. Quite tellingly, the most present Black characters are the unnamed enslaved people, Sutpen transports to Jefferson to build his estate.

						More simply, Sutpen arrives in Jefferson in 1833, marries Ellen Coldfield, has two children, and the son, Henry, makes a widow of the daughter, Judith. Why Henry shoots his sister's fiance is one of the central mysteries of <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>

						The different tellers of the tale - Miss Rosa, Mr. Compson, Quentin, and Shreve - all take these basic facts and arrange them to tell their versions of the story and give their explanation of the <i>why</i>.

					<div class="activity-instructions">
						<p>Though the plot can be very confusing, it is clear from Faulkner's notes that he had an underlying structure. This underlying structure is sometimes referred to as the <em>chronology</em> or <em>story</em>. In fiction, the story is different than the plot. Though often used interchangeably, the story refers to the order of events as they happen chronologically, while the plot indicates the order in which they are told.</p>
						<p>
							If the events in the novel were related in the order they occured, rather out of order, <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> would be much easier to understand. Actually, since the novel was so confusing even Faulkner's publishers asked him to include a chronology in the first edition of the text, so readers could get some grasp of the basic structure of the story. The structure of this chronology is already visible in the <a href="http://faulkner.iath.virginia.edu/media/resources/MANUSCRIPTS/AAMS1.html">early manuscript</a> pages of <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>
						</p>

						<p>
							Narratology is the study of narrative, and provides insight into how <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> is structured. By distinguishing between the order events as they occur (story) and the order in which they are told (plot), it is possible to create a chart of the narrative structure. In such a chart, the story is placed on the y-axis and the plot indicated by page numbers is placed on the x-axis. As the chart moves to the right, it moves forward in the progression of the text. Whenever something is plot higher or lower on the y-axis, it indicates when something is happening earlier (lower) or later (higher) chronologically. This concept is easier to grasp by looking at some major events in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> in <b>plot</b> and <b>story</b> order.

													<p>Thomas Sutpen's life can be reduced to three events: he is born, comes to Jefferson, and dies. In the novel, these events are out of order. Sutpen arrives in Jefferson in chapter 1, dies in chapter 6, and is born in chapter 7. Looking at the narrative structure, the plot starts in the middle of Sutpen's life moves to his death and then jumps back in time to cover his birth and early life.</p>

													<p>The narrated events all happen towards the end chronologically, when Quentin is gathering the story.</p>
													<p>It is also notable that the bulk of the events are about the time between when Sutpen marries Ellen to when Henry shoots Charles. In part, this is because the narrators all repeat and rework the events before this major event.</p>

					<h2 class="content_sub_title">Stories</h2>
					<div class="lesson-section">
						<p>The overlapping and disjointed versions of events capture Quentin's lived experience of exploring the past. This is not a neat linear chronology told by one authority in a history book, but the collective story of multiple voices who have shaped and reshaped the events to match their version of the truth. The tellers cannot be separated from their tales. It forces us to wonder if any version of the past can ever be true, or if it is simply another story we tell ourselves.</p>

				<div class="lesson-section">
					<p>
						The language in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> is very challenging. Faulkner's language constantly draws attention to itself.
						The text reminds us that <i>what</i> is said cannot be separated from <i>how</i> it is said.
					</p>
				</div>

				<h2 class="content_sub_title">The Long Sentence</h2>
				<div class="lesson-section">
					<p>Sentences in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> are very long. On average, sentences are around 50 words long. The longest sentence is 1,124 words. That's a 3-4 page college paper in one sentence! Compared to other American Classics, Faulkner's sentences are much, much longer.</p>

					<p>For Faulkner, these long sentences are more than rhetorical pyrotechnics, they try to capture how the past continuously intrudes upon the present. Asked in an interview about why he wrote such long sentences, Faulkner contends that there is no such thing as "was" because everyone brings their past with them. His long sentences are a way to capture this sensation. In an interview he claims:</p>

						<div class="blockquote-outline">
							<blockquote class="blockquote">"a man, a character in a story at any moment of action is not just himself as he is then, he is all that made him, and the long sentence is an attempt to get his past and possibly his future into the instant in which he does something"</blockquote>

					<p>In a sense, the prose complements the narrative structure, which also sees the past continuously returning.</p>
				</div>

				<h2 class="content_sub_title">Neologisms</h2>
				<div class="lesson-section">
					<p>
						Faulkner also concocts neologisms, new words, by combining words or adding a prefix to an existing word. There are 30 of such words and many other words that are uncommon or archaic.
					</p>
					<p>Often their meaning tarries between simple binaries, collapsing the neat distinctions created by language.</p>

				<div class="lesson-section">
					<p>Faulkner's recondite vocabulary draws attention to the fact that each individual fact disclosed by the teller is composed of individual words. These words can only be understood in context.</p>
				</div>

				<h2 class="content_sub_title">Parentheticals</h2>
				<div class="lesson-section">
					<p>
						Perhaps the most unique feature of the text is Faulkner's use of parentheses. There are 1278 total or 639 pairs. These parentheses occur across the text, and also nest within each other four levels deep.
					</p>
					<div class="my-4">
						<ul class="text-center">
							<li>() Level 1</li>
							<li>(()) Level 2</li>
							<li>((())) Level 3</li>
							<li>(((()))) Level 4</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>
						The nestings offer a network of digressions, modifications, amplifications, and dead ends. They represent the constant search for words to tell the story of the Sutpen family.

				<h2 class="content_sub_title">Faulkner's Language</h2>
				<div class="lesson-section">
					<p>The complexity of Faulkner's language forces the reader to consider the meaning of every word, in every long sentence, throughout the entire work. One cannot pull at any thread in the novel without loosening others. The past existed as a reality, but it can only be translated into the present in and through language.</p>
