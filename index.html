It includes visualizations that are not possible to represent in print. It also functions as a standalone essay that explores characters, event, and language and events in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> using various data visualizations and displays. Each section can be read separately, but also forms part of a larger argument about the text: the characters, events, and language all refuse to let America's racial legacy stay neatly cordoned away in the past. Instead, they continue to haunt the present.

							<p>
								One of the most salient pieces of demographic information in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> is its racial composition. The novel powerfully captures the Southern system of racial oppression that started with the enslavement of Africans before the Civil War and was continued through the creation of "Jim Crow" segregation laws after the Emancipation Proclamation. This long history of racial separation and its codification into explicit laws and implicit social practices, made race appear as a real and fundamental difference between people, even, if it was entirely socially constructed. Speaking of race in America more generally, Toni Morrison remarks that, "As a reader you have been forced to hunt for a drop of black blood that means everything and nothing. The insanity of racism." <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> captures this "insanity" through the obsession each narrator has with race and kinship.

				<h2 class="content_sub_title">Racial Demographics and Narrative Presence</h2>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col">
						<div class="activity-instructions">
							<p>
								Faulkner questions the differentiation of people based on race by suggesting that Charles Bon could be both brother and other to Judith and Henry Sutpen. This troubling of racial categories is visible in the demographic breakdown of the characters in the novel. There are 194 unique characters in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>. These characters can, in turn, be grouped by race. Doing so creates a <span class="fw-bold">raw demographic total</span> for each group that can be converted to a percentage of the total number of the total population.
							</p>
							<p>
								This raw demographic breakdown does not tell the whole story though. It does not take into account how often characters with different racial backgrounds actually appear in events. For example, there are 3 Native American characters who represent 2% of the total population of 194 characters. Yet, they occur so infrequently in the text that their <span class="fw-bold">weighted demographic presence</span> is virtually 0%. The difference between the <span class="fw-bold">raw demographic total</span> and the <span class="fw-bold">weighted demographic presence</span> tells a powerful story about what kinds of characters get prioritized in the narrative.

												<p>The difference between raw demographic total and weighted presence is almost equally as large for mixed ancestry characters.</p>

							<p>
								The data suggest that while <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> is concerned with the 'color line', it is decidedly from a White perspective. Race and racial passing is only conceived in how it might trouble Whiteness and not how it might affect the Black community. This is visible with the presence of Charles Bon. He is the most ubiquitous Mixed Ancestry character by far. Still, compared to the other White characters he is simply another major character. Quite tellingly, the most present Black characters are the unnamed enslaved people, Sutpen transports to Jefferson to build his estate.

				<div class="lesson-section">
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col">
							<div class="activity-instructions">
								<p>Though the plot can be very confusing, it is clear from Faulkner's notes that he had an underlying structure. This underlying structure is sometimes referred to as the <em>chronology</em> or <em>story</em>. In fiction, the story is different than the plot. Though often used interchangeably, the story refers to the order of events as they happen chronologically, while the plot indicates the order in which they are told.</p>
								<p>
									If the events in the novel were related in the order they occurred, <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> would be much easier to understand. Actually, since the novel was so confusing even Faulkner's publishers asked him to include a chronology in the first edition of the text, so readers could get some grasp of the basic structure of the story. The structure of this chronology is already visible in the <a href="http://faulkner.iath.virginia.edu/media/resources/MANUSCRIPTS/AAMS1.html">early manuscript</a> pages of <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>
								</p>

								<p>
									Steve Railton reconstructed the <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> chronology in detail and created an <a href="https://faulkner.iath.virginia.edu/family/aa_events.php">interactive chronology</a> based on key events. The full chronology in the DY database consists of 644 individual events. Broadly speaking, these can be displayed in two ways: <ol class="activity-list">
										<li><span class="fw-bold">Story</span> - The chronological order in which events occur.</li>
										<li><span class="fw-bold">Plot</span> - The order in which events are told in the narrative.</li>
									</ol>
									A <span class="fw-bold">narrative structure</span> chart shows the relationship between story and plot. The story order is placed on the y-axis and the plot order, indicated by page numbers, is placed on the x-axis. As the chart moves to the right, it moves forward in the progression of the text. Whenever an event occurs <em>lower</em> on the y-axis, it indicates that it is happening earlier in the chronology. Conversely, whenever an event his <em>higher</em> on the y-axis it is happening later in the chronology of the story. This concept is easier to grasp by looking at some major events in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> in <b>plot</b> and <b>story</b> order.

												<p>In the novel, these events are out of order. Sutpen arrives in Jefferson in chapter 1, dies in chapter 6, and is born in chapter 7. Accordingly, the narrative structure chart shows his arrival in the middle of the y-axis, death at the top and birth at the bottom.</p>

								<p>The overlapping and disjointed versions of events capture Quentin's lived experience of exploring the past. This is not a neat linear chronology told by one authority in a history book, but the collective story of multiple voices who have shaped and reshaped the events to match their version of the truth. The tellers cannot be separated from their tales. It forces us to wonder if any version of the past can ever be true, or if it is simply another story we tell ourselves.</p>

								The language in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> is very challenging. Faulkner's language constantly draws attention to itself.

				<p>For Faulkner, these long sentences are more than rhetorical pyrotechnics, they try to capture how the past continuously intrudes upon the present. Asked in an interview about why he wrote such long sentences, Faulkner contends that there is no such thing as "was" because everyone brings their past with them. His long sentences are a way to capture this sensation. In an interview he claims:</p>
				<blockquote class="activity-quote-full">
					<p>
						"a man, a character in a story at any moment of action is not just himself as he is then, he is all that made him, and the long sentence is an attempt to get his past and possibly his future into the instant in which he does something"
					</p>

				<p>In a sense, the prose complements the narrative structure, which also sees the past continuously returning.</p>

								Perhaps the most unique feature of the text is Faulkner's use of parentheses. There are 1278 total or 639 pairs. These parentheses occur across the text, and also nest within each other four levels deep.

							<p>The parenthesis chart shows two important features. Parenthesis occur throughout the text but are most concentrated in chapter 6. Here the narrator keeps nesting deeper. Read grammatically, these are ever more baroque "asides" to the main narrative until the last final aside four levels deep is Quentin. Though it seems implausible that Faulkner planted this nesting four levels deep for readers to discover, it is a poetic reminder that <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> is as much about Sutpen as it is about Quentin's understanding of Sutpen.</p>

							<p>The complexity of Faulkner's language forces the reader to consider the meaning of every word, in every long sentence, throughout the entire work. One cannot pull at any thread in the novel without loosening others. The past existed as a reality, but it can only be translated into the present in and through language.</p>
