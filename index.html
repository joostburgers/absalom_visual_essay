It includes visualizations that are not possible to represent in print. It also functions as a standalone essay that explores how characters, event, and language and events in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>. <!--add a sentence on each heading--> Each section can be read seperately, but also forms part of a larger argument about the text: the characters, events, and language all refuse to let America's racial legacy stay neatly cordoned away in the past.

								The <em>Digital Yoknapatawpha</em> database contains every character who appears in Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha fictions.
								Each character has a set of attribute information, including their race, class, gender, number, rank, and vitality.
								With this information, we can make a literary demography of the composition of the entire character population.

						<div class="activity-instructions">
							<p>
								One of the most salient pieces of demographic information in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> is its racial composition. The novel powerfully captures the Southern system of racial oppression that started with the enslavement of Africans before the Civil War and was continued through the creation of "Jim Crow" segretation laws after the Emancipation Proclamation. This long history of racial separation and its codification into explicit laws and implicit social practices, made race appear as a real and fundamental difference between people, even, if it was entirely socially constructed. Speaking of race in America more generally, Toni Morrison remarks that, "As a reader you have been forced to hunt for a drop of black blood that means everything and nothing. The insanity of racism."

				<h2 class="content_sub_title">Racial Presence</h2>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<div class="activity-instructions">
							<p>
								Faulkner questions the difference between people based on race by suggesting that Charles Bon could be both brother and other to Judith and Henry Sutpen. This troubling of racial categories is visible in the character breakdown of the novel. There are 194 unique characters in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>. These characters can in turn be grouped by race. Doing so creates a raw demographic total for each group. This indicates the relative percentage of each racial group of the entire cast of characters.
							</p>
							<p>
								Notably, this breakdown does not take into account how often characters occur. By calculating how often characters of a particular race occur in an event across the novel, we can capture how present they are in the novel. If <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> were a movie, this would be the relative screen-time dedicated to each racial group.

												<p>There are important differences between the raw demographic total and the weighted demographic presence.</p>
												<p>Both multi-racial groups and the few Indian characters who populate the novel's world do not even register when they are weighted for their presence within the plot.</p>
											</div>

											<div class="step-text" data-step="1">
												<div class="step_header">Over-representation</div>
												<p>Meanwhile, weighting by narrative presence actually reveals that White characters are over-represented. They only constitute 66% of the total characters, but are present in 77% of events.</p>
												<p>This shows that the narrative is focused on relating the lives of the White characters more than the other characters present.</p>
											</div>

											<div class="step-text" data-step="2">
												<div class="step_header">Mixed Ancestry</div>
												<p>Likewise, by accounting for how often characters actually appear in the text, the number of of mixed ancestry characters goes up.</p>
												<p>Intuitively, this makes sense because while there are relatively few of these characters in the world of the text, characters like Clytemnestra and Charles Bon appear quite often.</p>
											</div>

											<div class="step-text" data-step="3">
												<div class="step_header">Erasing Blackness</div>
												<p>Importantly, the increased focus on mixed ancestry characters comes at the cost of the Black characters. As individuals these characters recede into the background and do not have the same narrative presence as the white and the mixed ancestry characters.</p>
												<p>This distinction highlights the fact that novel is focused on showing White characters interact with characters of Mixed Ancestry.</p>

							<p>
								The data suggest that while <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> is concerned with the 'color line', it is decidedly from a White perspective. Race and racial passing is only conceived in how it might trouble Whiteness and not how it might affect the Black community. This is visible with the presence of Charles Bon. He is the most ubiquitous Mixed Ancestry character by far. Still, compared to the other White characters he is simply another major character. Quite tellingly, the most present Black characters are the unnamed enslaved people, Sutpen transports to Jefferson to build his estate.

								It is clear from reading <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> that the novel is about Charles Bon's potential transgression across the 'color line.' The data reveal that the novel attends to this issue from a predominantly White perspective, and at the exclusion of all other non-white characters.
							</p>
							<p>
								The various narrators only really care about racial passing if it threatens upper class white femininity. There is never a consideration as to how passing might affect the Black community.

					<p><i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> resists summary. It is told from multiple, contradictory perspectives that each re-tell the same set of historical events. As each narrator tries to understand <i>why</i> the events happened they fundamentally reshape <i>what</i> happens. The basic facts are outlined cryptically in the opening pages:</p>

							<blockquote class="blockquote">"Sunday morning in June in 1833 when he [Sutpen] first rode into town out of no discernible past and acquired his land no one knew how and built his house, his mansion, apparently out of nothing and married Ellen Coldfield and begot his two children - the son who widowed the daughter who had not yet been a bride - and so accomplished his allotted course to its violent...end"</blockquote>

					<p>
						More simply, Sutpen arrives in Jefferson in 1833, marries Ellen Coldfield, has two children, and the son, Henry, makes a widow of the daughter, Judith. Why Henry shoots his sister's fiance is one of the central mysteries of <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						The different tellers of the tale - Miss Rosa, Mr. Compson, Quentin, and Shreve - all take these basic facts and arrange them to tell their versions of the story and give their explanation of the <i>why</i>. What is revealing is not just what the narrators say, but also what they do not say. Each teller leaves out important clues that might help understand what happened. There is no way to ever get the "whole" story.

				<h2 class="content_sub_title">Narratology</h2>
				<div class="lesson-section">
					<p>Though the plot can be very confusing, it is clear from Faulkner's notes that he had an underlying structure. This underlying structure is sometimes referred to as the <em>chronology</em> or <em>story</em>. In fiction, the story is different than the plot. Though often used interchangeably, the story refers to the order of events as they happen chronologically, while the plot indicates the order in which they are told.</p>
					<p>
						If the events in the novel were related in the order they occured, rather out of order, <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> would be much easier to understand. Actually, since the novel was so confusing even Faulkner's publishers asked him to include a chronology in the first edition of the text, so readers could get some grasp of the basic structure of the story. The structure of this chronology is already visible in the <a href="http://faulkner.iath.virginia.edu/media/resources/MANUSCRIPTS/AAMS1.html">early manuscript</a> pages of <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						Narratology is the study of narrative, and provides insight into how <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> is structured. By distinguishing between the order events as they occur (story) and the order in which they are told (plot), it is possible to create a chart of the narrative structure. In such a chart, the story is placed on the y-axis and the plot indicated by page numbers is placed on the x-axis. As the chart moves to the right, it moves forward in the progression of the text. Whenever something is plot higher or lower on the y-axis, it indicates when something is happening earlier (lower) or later (higher) chronologically. This concept is easier to grasp by looking at some major events in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> in <b>plot</b> and <b>story</b> order.

												<div class="step_header">Story Order</div>
												<p>Viewed in story order, the events move from the bottom left to the top right. This is because x=y.</p>

												<div class="step_header">All Events</div>
												<p>Digital Yoknapatawpha has broken down <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> into 644 individual events. These points can be plotted using the same narrative structure method.</p>
												<p>It looks like an overwhelming jumble! </p>
												<p>The major events provide some context as to what might be going on.</p>
												<p class="fst-italic"> Hover over the chart to see the description of each event.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="step-text" data-step="3">
												<div class="step_header">Narrated Events</div>
												<p> The structure of the narrative becomes a bit clearer when the events are broken down by the way in which they are related to the reader.</p>  <p>Digital Yoknapatawpha calls this <i>narrative status</i>.</p>
												<p>The narrated events mostly run in a regular pattern from left to right at the top of the chart. These are the moments when the Quentin speaks to the different narrators. </p>
											</div>
											<div class="step-text" data-step="4">
												<div class="step_header">Told Events</div>
												<p>The told events show the tales of each individual storyteller.</p>
												<p>They make a pronounced "S" curve.</p>
												<p>The tellers each start their stories in the deep past and make their way to the present.</p>
												<p>Even though, they repeat, change, and omit details that occur in the other versions. The chronologies of the individual stories are actually fairly regular.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="step-text" data-step="5">
												<div class="step_header">Other Events</div>
												<p>Digital Yoknapatawpha also encodes three other types of events: Remembered, Hypothesized, and narrated+consciousness which is unique to Faulkner.</p>
												<p>These types of events are much fewer in number, but their presence adds another layer of mediation between the tellers and their tales. </p>
											</div>
											<div class="step-text" data-step="6">
												<div class="step_header">Story Order</div>
												<p>Story order makes the distinction between narrated and told events clearer.</p>
												<p>The narrated events all happen towards the end chronologically, when Quentin is gathering the story.</p>
												<p>It is also notable that the bulk of the events are about the time between when Sutpen marries Ellen to when Henry shoots Charles. In part, this is because the narrators all repeat and rework the events before this major event.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="step-text" data-step="7">
												<div class="step_header">Chronology by Date</div>
												<p>Digital Yoknapatawpha also encodes likely dates for when events happened.</p>
												<p>Ordering the events by their chronological dates changes the distances between the events because they are now determined by date and not by their chronological rank.</p>
												<p>This heightens the distance between the story of Sutpen and Quentin's narrative present.</p>
												<p>Past and present appear disconnected.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="step-text" data-step="8">
												<div class="step_header">Chronology in Order by Date</div>
												<p>Placing the entire chronology in order by date instead shows the continuity between past and present.</p>
												<p>Quentin is not so comfortably removed from Sutpen as it might seem.</p>
												<p>It also stresses the importance of the Civil War as a pivot for the narrative.</p>
												<p>For the South, and indeed the United States more broadly, this is was a cataclysmic event whose meaning, fifty years later in Quentin's time, is still not settled.</p>
												<p>Understanding why Henry shoots Charles cannot be disentangled from this history.</p>

					<p>The overlapping and disjointed versions of events capture Quentin's lived experience of exploring the past. This is not a neat linear chronology told by one authority in a history book, but the collective story of multiple voices who have shaped and reshaped the events to match their version of the truth. The tellers cannot be separated from their tales. It forces us to wonder if any version of the past can ever be true, or if it is simply another story we tell ourselves.</p>
